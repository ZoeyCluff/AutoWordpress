## AutoPress automated NGINX / Wordpress / Cloudflare / LetsEncrypt Installer

This is a pet project I use for a personal project that will let me setup blogs for my friends as quickly and as automated as possible. This is the 2nd Python script I've written so it's probably not the best practices (This is basically v1.5 of my first one with a little more logic, and not hardcoded for a single site.). Eventually I may make a script that will take a fresh install of Linux and fully setup NGINX and your blog automagically.



# This code is tested in V0.15 and is based off that. I haven't done much testing on this code yet but there are only minor changes.
